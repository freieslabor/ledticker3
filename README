Control Lunartec LED tickers (PE-9441). PHP implementation of Veit Wahlich's LED Ticker 1.1.1.

This code converts your text (420 chars max per message) into a valid protocol message the LED ticker understands and displays.

The PHP implementation is designed for e.g. routers connected to this kind of led tickers, which cannot run the original Perl version. A webserver can provide the valid final message and serve it to the router. The router could request the message via a simple wget solution and pipe it to the USB-to-RS232 converter connected to the LED ticker. The logic for generating texts can be easily handled on the server side.
